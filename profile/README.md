## Hey there 👋 

Welcome to **GitHub Discord**, we are an online community that
aims to help and educate people about **GitHub** and the wonders
of **open-source software development**. Feel free to join the
[GitHub Discord server](https://discord.gg/ytCRYq4m), which is 
the hub of the *smartest branch in the Octoverse!*

You *seem* to have stumbled upon our ✨ **GitHub organisation** ✨.
Within this holy sanctum, you'll find our open-source community projects 🚀.
Feel free to help out with these - your contributions won't go amiss! If
you have any queries about contribution check out the contributing
guidelines for an individual project, or head over to the `#dev-discussion`
channel on our Discord server for a **friendly helping hand**.
